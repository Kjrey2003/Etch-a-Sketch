# Etch-a-Sketch
Had to do this project because of the odin project. It's a little thing where when the mouese passes over the square it fills little squares with your color of choice.
I am going to start saying the challenges I faced/what I learned from each project.
I honestly didn't even know how to create the squares at first, so I learned how to use javascript and queryselectors and dom manipulating to do so.
I also didn't know how to do mouseovers but clearly I now :)
I had a little trouble with linking colors to the function but I eventually learned Html has an input color selector. I was honestly suprised.
And that's mostly it, I may improve this in the future but right now on 7/25/22 I am finished with Etch-a-Sketch
